Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, we were given started code for the treasure hunt game and we needed to create a section of code that directed the agent through the course to find the treasure while avoiding any obstructions. We were provided the layout, the variables, and the actions that the agent was capable of. It was our job to process how the agent would interpret the data and how it would utilize the data in order to successfully navigate the map.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists aim to build and improve upon the existing data and processes that systems currently handle. They will look to ensure that a code in optimized and handling all of its requested functionalities, and will try to improve it to maximize the performance of the system.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, my goal when approaching this code was to first get the agent to complete the goal (find the treasure). I created code that would navigate the agent through a process of moved in order to find which directions will fial and which will succeed. My next goal was to try an optimize the code once the agent has completed the system.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
With many of the advancements we see in technology today, they often come at a cost, whether that cost is known to its users or hides itself well. The concerns with the many advancements we see today are that often times their negative impacts often reside within ethical questionability and can alienate a certain demographic or user group. It is my goal as a developer to do my best to create an application that operates the same for every user that chooses my application, regardless of any veriables that may not be equivelent across the board.
